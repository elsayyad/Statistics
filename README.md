# Statistics
Statistics projects done with Python

**Analyze A/B Test Results**

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that to get some practice working with the difficulties of these 

For this project, the aim is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

**Analyzing the Stroop Effect**

In this project, an investigation of a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect will be done.The aim is to learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. Then some data collected be investigated for subjects who have performed the same task/experiment. Then some statistics will be computed describing the results. Finally, the results will be interpreted in terms of your hypotheses and T-Test.
